# MAGE: Microframework for Apps on the Google Engine

MAGE is a sessionless web framework built to structure and ease development of web apps running on Google App Engine using the Go API.

It exposes a simple lifecycle and implements its own very performant, low-allocation routing system.

MAGE comes with a fully fledged, optional ORM-like layer (the model package) over the Datastore and Memcache APIs to help keep quotas low while increasing productivity. 

Mage has zero dependencies, except for the Google Client Libraries and the Appengine Package (for obvious reasons).

Mage is 100% compatible with GAE go1.11 API
